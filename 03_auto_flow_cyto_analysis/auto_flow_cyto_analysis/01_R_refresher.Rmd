# R programming refresher
# Author: R. Burke Squires, Radina Droumeva

# First, a short refresher to R

## Variable Assignment
x <- 5
y <- 10
x + y

# Vectors (one dimensional) and Matrices (two dimensional)
x <- c(1, 4, 5)
x
y <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, by = 1)
y
x + y

# Get help on how to construct a matrix
?matrix
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3,  11, 12, 13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
A
rbind(x, y)
A + rbind(x, y)
A[1, 3]
A[2, ]
A[, 1]

# Lists and names
mylist <- list(`first` = x, `second` = y)
mylist
mylist[[1]]
mylist[["first"]]
mylist[[3]]
length(mylist)
length(x)
dim(A)

# More advanced functionality: which, intersect, union
?rnorm
a <- rnorm(20)
a
which(a > 0)
a[1]
a[which(a > 0)]
which(a < -1)
intersect(which(a > 0), which(a < -1))
combined <- union(which(a > 0), which(a < -1))
combined
length(combined)

# Simple plotting
plot(a, col = "red")
plot(density(a))
hist(a)
plot(density(rnorm(1000)))
